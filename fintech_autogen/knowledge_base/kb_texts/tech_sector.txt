The technology sector is comprised of businesses that sell goods and services in electronics, software, computers, artificial intelligence, and other industries related to information technology.
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. It offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
Semiconductor companies design and manufacture computer chips and related components. They are crucial suppliers to technology hardware manufacturers.
SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. Examples include Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored globally on thousands of servers, making it nearly impossible to alter records retroactively.
Fintech startups often leverage APIs to connect financial data and services across platforms, enabling innovation in payments, lending, and investing.
Quantum computing uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform computation, potentially solving problems in seconds that would take classical computers millennia.
Cybersecurity in the tech sector involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, which are increasingly sophisticated and frequent.
Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data, improving response times and saving bandwidth.
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors and software to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
Augmented reality (AR) overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user experiences in gaming, retail, and education.
5G is the fifth generation of mobile network technology, offering faster speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connections for mobile devices.
