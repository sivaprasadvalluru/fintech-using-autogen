What is an ETF?
An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, bonds, or commodities and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value.

Benefits of ETFs:
- Diversification: ETFs often track a broad market index, providing instant diversification.
- Liquidity: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.
- Low cost: ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds.
- Transparency: Holdings are usually disclosed daily.

Recent ETF Market Trends (2025):
- Thematic ETFs focusing on AI, green energy, and technology have seen significant inflows.
- Bond ETFs are gaining popularity as investors seek yield in a low-interest-rate environment.
- Actively managed ETFs are growing, offering more flexibility than traditional passive ETFs.
- Regulatory changes are making it easier to launch new ETFs, increasing competition and innovation.

Risks:
- Market risk: ETFs are subject to the same market risks as their underlying assets.
- Tracking error: Some ETFs may not perfectly track their benchmark index.
- Liquidity risk: Niche or low-volume ETFs may have wider bid-ask spreads.
