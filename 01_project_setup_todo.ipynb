    "We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python dependency management and environment creation. `uv` can create a virtual environment and initialize your project, automatically generating a `pyproject.toml` file for you. You can also use `uv init` to quickly scaffold a new Python project with a virtual environment and `pyproject.toml` in one step.\n",
